* 10.6.2025: **Todor Arnaudov, Calculus of Art I: Music I**, 12.2012/10.6.2025, 46 pages. <!-- **Abstract:** On origins, criteria, confusions and methods for measuring the musical beauty and beauty in general sensory modalities and domains, and a discussion and answer to the paper “Musical beauty and information compression: Complex to the ear, but simple to the mind”, which rediscovers some core conclusions from the earlier Theory of Universe and Mind about the universality of compression and prediction for cognition, the origin of cognitive pleasure as a by effect of the general operation of intelligence: maximizing matching and successful prediction of sequences and the common origin of science and art and music as prediction and compression; however “Calculus of Art” challenges claims and methods for measuring the complexity and cognitive pleasure from the referred paper and proposes methods and ideas from Calculus, requiring Art, Music and any domain to be “pleasurable” or predictable, compressible etc. in the whole range of scales of time and space and to be explored, studied, produced, generated, perceived, evaluated etc. incrementally, gradually, step-by-step expanded both in time and space, starting from the smallest possible ones and continually growing and evaluating the ranges,  features, qualities, “pleasure”; and when comparing beauty, evaluating the features which humans or a generally intelligent compression system would recognize, compress and predict. A broader introduction and justification of prerequisite concepts and the basis of the reasoning is given in the first half of the paper. This is an entry to more technical future works and practical implementations.

Other possible publications or workshops (or subparts of the ones mentioned above)

**Todor Arnaudov:**

* The book "The Prophets of the Thinking Machine: AGI & Transhumanism: History, Theory and Pioneers[ & Present and Future]" a survey of the history of AI, AI prophets and "Todor's predictions" or <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">Theory of Universe and Mind</a> within the landscape: the works of a teenage boy that were decades ahead of the current top interdisciplinary researchers and AI mainstream (yet they were also rediscovering other forgotten "prophets"). A presentation of the "biblical" documentary collection book proving the pioneering work and correct predictions, probably also a presentation about the new piece from the theory which is not published yet: "Universe and Mind 6" etc., which compares with recent talks and claims of similar recent works from the school of thought of Karl Friston, Michael Levin, their colleagues and students etc.

* English: http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2012/07/news-sigi-2012-1-first-sigi-agi.html

*About the first participants:*

Dr. Petar Kormushev was renowned researcher in robotics and ML: https://kormushev.com/

Daniel and Svetlin are cofounders of the AI startup "Efemarai": https://www.efemarai.com/

Orlin is a roboticist.

Georgi was a student from the world's first university course in AGI - the second version from 2011 (the first: 2010)

Todor was the author of the world's first AGI course and of the pioneering "Theory of Universe and Mind"

Alexander was a software developer with interests in transhumanism, singularity and Numenta nad Jeff Hawkins' work.

...

I don't know the format yet, the conference might be combined: partially online, partially in person.

The details would be specified later.

Perhaps it would be free, especially if online, if we meet somewhere and we're too much we may need to rent a conference room or something or just gather somewhere else.
 
Depending on the participants it could be in either English and/or Bulgarian.

The possible dates and organization will be decided together with the prospective coorganizers and participants.

It would be great if we could arrange the meeting/seminars to be hosted by a University.

.....

* Earlier notes:  The exact way of conducting is not specified yet, it could be just a gathering, a place for publishing your work, videos and let the others see, comment, contact each others etc.

The goal was the event to be presented in 2023, but the "chairman" T.A. was busy and if it couldn't be organised until the end of the year it may be in 2024 or so and then it moved to 2025. :)
