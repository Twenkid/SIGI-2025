...

The purpose of this "rolling" whole-year long meeting is to be a show case and a gathering of R&D people who look for collaborators, partners or interesting projects and topics.

The Sacred Computers' original alternative terms for Artificial General Intelligence: Artificial Mind, Изкуствен Разум, Мислеща машина, VLESI: Versatile Limitless Explorer and Self-Improver and variants such as VEI: Versatile Explorer and Improver ... EI: Explorer and Improver. VGEI: Versatile Generalizer Explorer and Improver... //note from 27.3.2024
* EMI - Explorer Mapper Improver ... (2025) 

## Invitation for partners, participants and coorganizers! Покана за участници! Приглашение участников! 

See below information about the first one from 2012:

Provisional sample program and participants

* Principal Organizer: "The Sacred Computer" AGI & Transhumanism institute, Todor Arnaudov (looking for coorganizers)
* Wanted co-organizers from the fields of Robotcs, AI, ML, Aerospace, Software, ...

<b>Possible (provisional) topics:</b>

**Todor Arnaudov:**

* The book "The Prophets of the Thinking Machine: AGI & Transhumanism: History, Theory and Pioneers[ & Present and Future]" a survey of the history of AI, AI prophets and "Todor's predictions" or <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">Theory of Universe and Mind</a> within the landscape: the works of a teenage boy that were decades ahead of the current top interdisciplinary researchers and AI mainstream (yet they were also rediscovering other forgotten "prophets"). A presentation of the "biblical" documentary collection book proving the pioneering work and correct predictions, probably also a presentation about the new piece from the theory which is not published yet: "Universe and Mind 6" etc., which compares with recent talks and claims of similar recent works from the school of thought of Karl Friston, Michael Levin, their colleagues and students etc.
* Master of All Trades <s>"Jack of All Trades"</s> - a project for building an AGI infrastructure: summary of directions, plans (looking for partners) - see the repo and the issues: https://github.com/Twenkid/Vsy-Jack-Of-All-Trades-AGI-Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine

* English: http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2012/07/news-sigi-2012-1-first-sigi-agi.html

*About the first participants:*

Dr. Petar Kormushev was renowned researcher in robotics and ML: https://kormushev.com/

Daniel and Svetlin are cofounders of the AI startup "Efemarai": https://www.efemarai.com/

Orlin is a roboticist.

Georgi was a student from the world's first university course in AGI - the second version from 2011 (the first: 2010)

Todor was the author of the world's first AGI course and of the pioneering "Theory of Universe and Mind"

Alexander was a software developer with interests in transhumanism, singularity and Numenta nad Jeff Hawkins' work.

...

I don't know the format yet, the conference might be combined: partially online, partially in person.

The details would be specified later.

Perhaps it would be free, especially if online, if we meet somewhere and we're too much we may need to rent a conference room or something or just gather somewhere else.
 
Depending on the participants it could be in either English and/or Bulgarian.

The possible dates and organization will be decided together with the prospective coorganizers and participants.

It would be great if we could arrange the meeting/seminars to be hosted by a University.

.....

* Earlier notes:  The exact way of conducting is not specified yet, it could be just a gathering, a place for publishing your work, videos and let the others see, comment, contact each others etc.

The goal was the event to be presented in 2023, but the "chairman" T.A. was busy and if it couldn't be organised until the end of the year it may be in 2024 or so and then it moved to 2025. :)
